        Welcome to the developer reference to Exhale Companion.  The code being
        documented here is largely meaningless and was only created to test
        various corner cases e.g. nested namespaces and the like.

        .. note::

            The text you are currently reading was fed to ``exhale_args`` using
            the :py:data:`~exhale.configs.afterTitleDescription` key.  Full
            reStructuredText syntax can be used.

        .. tip::

           Sphinx / Exhale support unicode!  You're ``conf.py`` already has
           it's encoding declared as ``# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-`` **by
           default**.  If you want to pass Unicode strings into Exhale, simply
           prefix them with a ``u`` e.g. ``u"ðŸ‘½ðŸ˜±ðŸ’¥"`` (of course you would
           actually do this because you are writing with Ã¥Ã§Ä‡Ã«Ã±tÃŸ or
           non-English å¯«ä½œ ðŸ˜‰).

        2. The Title of the next section *just below this* normally defaults to
           ``Full API``, but the title was changed by providing an argument to
           :py:data:`~exhale.configs.fullApiSubSectionTitle`.
        3. You can control the number of bullet points for each linked item on
           the remainder of the page using

        available for you to use if you want it, but from a design perspective
        it's rather unlikely any of your users will even see this text.
